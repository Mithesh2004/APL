# DataSet1-Linear Regression with Error Analysis

This Python script performs linear regression on a dataset and includes error analysis with error bars.

## Dependencies

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Required Python packages (install via `pip install [package_name]`):
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`

## Usage

1. Save the file in the system

2. Navigate to the folder in which the file is saved
   ```bash
   cd [folder_path]
   ```
3. Run the Script

   In windows:
   ```bash
   python dataset1.py
   ```
   In linux/mac-os:
   ```bash
   python3 dataset1.py
   ```
## Input

- The input data file (`dataset1.txt`) should be located in the `./a3-data/` directory. Ensure that the file is correctly formatted with x-values in the first column and corresponding y-values in the second column.

## Output

- On running the file the plot for the program will be saved as dataset1.png in the same folder the program is in.


# DataSet2-Sinusoidal Curve Fitting

This Python script performs curve fitting on a dataset using both the Least Squares method and the Curve Fitting method.

## Dependencies

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Required Python packages (install via `pip install [package_name]`):
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scipy`

## Usage

1. Save the file in the system

2. Navigate to the folder in which the file is saved
   ```bash
   cd [folder_path]
   ```
3. Run the Script

   In windows:
   ```bash
   python dataset2.py
   ```
   In linux/mac-os:
   ```bash
   python3 dataset2.py
   ```
## Input

- The input data file (`dataset2.txt`) should be located in the `./a3-data/` directory. Ensure that the file is correctly formatted with x-values in the first column and corresponding y-values in the second column.

## Output

- On running the file the plot for the program will be saved as dataset2.png in the same folder the program is in.
- The equations of the sine wave and the frequency will be displyed in the ouput terminal.


# DataSet3_1-Planck Equation and Temperature Estimation

This Python script fits data to the Planck equation to estimate the temperature at which the data was simulated.

## Dependencies

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Required Python packages (install via `pip install [package_name]`):
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scipy`

## Usage

1. Save the file in the system

2. Navigate to the folder in which the file is saved
   ```bash
   cd [folder_path]
   ```
3. Run the Script

   In windows:
   ```bash
   python dataset3_1.py
   ```
   In linux/mac-os:
   ```bash
   python3 dataset3_1.py
   ```
## Input

- The input data file (`dataset3.txt`) should be located in the `./a3-data/` directory. Ensure that the file is correctly formatted with x-values in the first column and corresponding y-values in the second column.

## Output

- On running the file the plot for the program will be saved as dataset3_1.png in the same folder the program is in.
- The estimated temperature will be displayed in the output terminal.

# DataSet3_2-Planck Equation Parameter Estimation

This Python script fits data to the Planck equation to estimate the values of physical constants and the temperature at which the data was simulated.


## Dependencies

   python dataset3_2.py
   ```
   In linux/mac-os:
   ```bash
   python3 dataset3_2.py
   ```
## Input

- The input data file (`dataset3.txt`) should be located in the `./a3-data/` directory. Ensure that the file is correctly formatted with x-values in the first column and corresponding y-values in the second column.
